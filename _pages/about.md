Hi there! I'm Akio, nice to meet you. I'm a software engineer in one of the best startups in the country, working on the full software engineering stack plus some neat data science and machine learning stuff here and there. It has been a pretty nice ride! You can see a little bit more about my working experiences in my [full CV](https://akionakamura.github.io/cv/).

I have also recently finished my master's degree at the Electrical Engineering department from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), where I have also graduated in Control and Automation Engineering. The focus of my research was to investigate how a fully neural search engine would look like and perform. Go to my [publications page](https://akionakamura.github.io/publications/) to get the PDF, it is pretty cool stuff :)
