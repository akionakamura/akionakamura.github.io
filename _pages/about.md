Hi there! I'm Akio, nice to meet you. I'm a software engineer in the coolest startup in San Pedro Valley, working on the full software engineering stack plus some neat data science and machine learning stuff. It has been a pretty nice ride! You can see a little bit more about my working experiences in my [full CV](https://akionakamura.github.io/cv/).

I'm also currently doing my masters's at the Electrical Engineering department from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I've graduate there in Control and Automation Engineering and, although a great field of study, I ended up in the software development world, and my master's degree will follow that same path, being closer to the Computer Science than to Electrical Engineering. I'm investigating how the dense representation of documents, so called embeddings, can be used in the information retrieval problem.
