<blockquote>A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find that after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us.</blockquote>

<p>Travelling is one of my greatest passions. It all started when I lived in Italy as a child for around an year. Since then, I've also lived in Germany and the UK, besides my beloved homeland, and visited many other places. I believe experiencing the new is always exciting and few things does it better than travelling. You have spontaneous adventures, stories for life and usually get to see the best in people. You learn so much about yourself and others, you rarely come back the same. And food, there is always a different and awesome food right around the corner.</p>

<p>This is a map where I like to register some of the places I've been to :)</p>
