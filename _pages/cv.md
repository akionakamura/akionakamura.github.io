Profile
======
Pro-active, organized and ease working with teams. Objectivity, discipline and leadership are also important traits. Assiduous student, with good academic performance, alwayes willing to learn and share.

I've drifted a bit from the regular paths of my graduation to be a full stack software engineer and data scientist.

Education
======
* (2016 - 2018 (expected)) Masters degree in Computational Intelligence from the Electrical Engineering department of Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)
* (2009 - 2015) Undergraduate degree in Control and Automation Engineering by the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).
  - (Sept/2012 – Fev/2013) Academic Exchange Program in Mechanical Engineering by Fachhochschule Schmalkalden, Germany.
  - (Jan/2014 – Jan/2015) Academic Exchange Program in Electronic Engineering by Newcastle University, United Kingdom.
* (2006 - 2008) Electrotechnical and Industrial Automation Course integrated with High School by Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG).
  - Mandatory intership completed in PROJELET (CGC: 05.140.192/0001-55).

Work experience
======
* (Jan/2016 - current) Software engineer at WorldSense.
  - Continue to help to build up and develop the product as well as developing better machine learning methods to support our solution.
* (Mai/2015 - Dec/2015) Software engineering intern at WorldSense.
  - Started as an intern as WorldSense was being born as a startup, helped the company to build to produt from the ground, going all necessary steps, through big data processing, machine learning and full stack software engineering.
* (Jun/2012 - Dec/2015) Undergraduate Researcher in the Engineering School of UFMG.
  - Working under mentorship of Prof. André Paim Lemos in the R&D Project “Development and Implementation of Evolving Systems for Adaptive Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Processes and Equipments”.
  - Researched and studied Machine Learning techniques, specally methods based on Statistical Inference.
  - Developed and published the cientific paper “Adaptive Fault Detection and Diagnosis Using Parsimonious Gaussian Mixture Models Trained with Distributed Computing Techniques” (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfranklin.2016.11.024).
  - Developed and published the cientific paper “A Batch-Incremental Process Fault Detection and Diagnosis Using Mixtures of Probabilistic PCA” (DOI: http://10.1109/EAIS.2014.6867472).
* (Mar/2011 – Dec/2011) Undergradute Teaching Assistant of Computer Programming and Numerical
Analysis in the Exact Sciences Institue (ICEX) of UFMG.
  - Aid the students with different needs and backgrounds in their assigments.
  - Aid the professor with their assigments, whether programming, marking exercises or developing
materials.
* (Mar/2009 – Nov/2009) Intern in PROJELET – Projeto de Sistemas Prediais (CGC: 05.140.192/0001-55).
  -Design electrical, telecommunication, CCTV, fire detection and alarm systems infrastructure for commercial and residential buildings.
